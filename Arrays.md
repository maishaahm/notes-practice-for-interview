### [Arrays GeeksForGeeks ]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI_tIZFyKBw&t=3009s](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure-guide/))

A sequence of values stored in memory. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0.

**Types of Arrays**
1. One-Dimensional: single row of elements.
2. Multidimensional: store multiple rows of elements.

**Array Operations**
1. Traversal: visiting each element of an array in specific order (e.g. sequential, reverse).
2. Insertion: adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
3. Deletion: removing an element from an array at a specific index.
4. Searching: finding the index of an element in an array.

**Arrays in Java**
1. All arrays are dynamically allocated.
    - Memory for the array is allocated at runtime, rather than at compile-time. This allows arrays to be more flexibke, 
but it also means that once an array's size is set, it cannot be changed. If yyou need a larger array, you have to create a new one and copy the data over.
2. Arrays are objects in Java.
3. Array variavle is declared with [] after the data type.
4. Java arrays can also be used as a static field, a local variable, or a method parameter.
